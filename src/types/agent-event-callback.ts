/**
 * Defines the structure for callback functions used in voice agent events.
 *
 * This type encapsulates various event handlers that can be triggered during
 * the lifecycle of a voice agent connection. It includes callbacks for:
 *
 * - Connection establishment and termination
 * - Data reception
 * - Active device changes
 * - Mute status changes
 * - Connection state updates
 * - Server-side events
 *
 * These callbacks allow for fine-grained control and monitoring of the voice
 * agent's state and interactions, enabling developers to build responsive
 * and interactive voice-enabled applications.
